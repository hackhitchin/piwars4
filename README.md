# Piwars 4.0
Back at it again!

## Aim for this year
We decided this year to go back to grass routes and keep things as simple as possible. This notion lasted about 3 weeks before I saw a funky new distance sensor on kickstarter called the "protractor". It returns the distance and angle to the nearest item in its field of view. Kinda cool!

## Grass Routes
The design is using the basic shape of TITO 1 in that it has 4x wheels which are each powered by a 12v 1000rpm motor. The front two wheels are clamped to an articulated front end that allows one or other side to rise/fall independantly of the rear half.  
  
Having had a similar feature on TITO 1 and subsequently not on TITO 2, we now realise it's importance.  
  
This articulation allows all 4 wheels get best traction on a flat or undulating surface. Without it, small imperfections in tires / 3D printed chassis / or even on the floor equate to a single or multiple wheels not touching the ground and the bot not driving straight.
